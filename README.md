# Wellcome
So this is looking more and more like a journal, as I'm trying to make a commite each day eaven when I have no time.
This is the commit for today I imagine, 
It's 11:43 now, I need to make a other commit quick. its gone be a short one again. ah well the goal is to get used to it, it takes time.

Today I installed the new PyCharm, it looks quit different, more like an IOS App. I don't know yet if I like it, I guess only time will tell.

Today we are watching the finally of Stranger Things, so again sadly no time, but the time will come I promise where there will be a commit that is code not just lazy readme updates. See you tomorrow.
